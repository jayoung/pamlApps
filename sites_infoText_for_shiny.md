### Parse and plot rst file output from site-wise PAML

Input = an rst file (output of site-wise PAML, e.g. model 8).

Output options:  
- 1. a comma-separated version of the BEB results table that's easier to read into Excel than the original rst file, in case you want to play around with making plots yourself.
- 2. a plot of the BEB mean dN/dS estimate at each site
- 3. a plot of the BEB probabilities of each site being in the positively selected class

For an example of how this sort of analysis is used, see Fig 6C of a paper on tetherin evolution: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32238588/


### Instructions
- 1. upload your rst file
- 2. (optional) choose some display options
- 3. download the plot (as pdf) or the BEB results table (as csv)


### Advice
Open the pdf file you've downloaded, see how it looks, then adjust plot size if needed. Plot file dimensions do NOT affect how it appears within the app, only in the downloaded pdf.
