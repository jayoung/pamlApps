### Janet's app to parse and plot results from branch-wise PAML

Input=an mlc file (output of branch-wise PAML)

Output=a plot showing the tree with branch labels showing dN/dS (above the branch) and N\*dN and S\*dS (the number of non-synonymous and synonymous changes) in parentheses below the branch.

### Instructions
- 1. upload your mlc file
- 2. (optional) choose some display options
- 3. download the plot (as pdf)

### Advice
Open the pdf file you've downloaded, see how it looks, then adjust plot size if needed. Plot file dimensions do NOT affect how it appears within the app, only in the downloaded pdf.
